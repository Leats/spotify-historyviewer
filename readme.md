# Spotify-Historyviewer

This is a small repository that consists of some visualization and calculations that I am doing with the data I collected from my spotify listening data.
For more information how I collected the spotify data see [spotify-historymaker](https://github.com/leats/spotify-historymaker).

This is still very much a work in progress and under construction.

The `.csv` files are examples and not representative because I did not want to share my full listening history on here. They'll give you an idea on how this works, however.

Planned updates will be more visualizations, maybe also in a different format than the notebook. Nice would be a visualization similar to the "Wrapped" at the end of the year.
